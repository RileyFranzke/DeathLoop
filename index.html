    <h2>Deathloop: Aesthetics and Style</h2>
  <br>In 2021, Arkane Studios released "Deathloop", a small first-person shooter with little marketing and a low price on Steam. The game is unique, mixing a futuristic world with older, nostalgic aesthetics. The world built within the game is gorgeous yet mysterious. Character movement is fluid, while gunplay is realistic and rigid. The game is complex with many character elements changing how one can play, and many narrative objectives raising stakes and keeping the player engaged. Below is the game's official launch trailer:</br>

  <br>NARRATIVE</br>
<br>Set in an island called Blackreef, Deathloop starts with Colt, the main character, waking up on the island's beach with the objective of "breaking the loop". The people native to Blackreef are all stuck in the same time loop, and every day is the same. However, Colt retains his memories through each loop, as does the main antagonist, Julianna.
The island holds many visionaries responsible for the time loop, which is still a mystery and one that Colt has to solve to break the loop. As you move through the game as Colt, you collect weapons and "slabs" which enable certain powers for Colt. Killing all the visionaries and finding all the island's secrets allows Colt to finally "break the loop".</br>
<br>ENDING</br>
<br>The game has three possible endings. One being the main one, which has Colt killing Julianna and jumping off the loop control center platform. The game cuts to black but cuts back to the beginning of the game. Colt wakes up on the beach, but the sky is different. Julianna appears momentarily, pointing a gun at Colt, then leaves. Arkane Studios says this is the main ending that is canon.</br>
<br>The second ending has Colt sitting down with Julianna in the control center, deciding to do nothing. They continue to play the same game they have been playing.</br>
<br>The third ending has Colt killing Julianna but not jumping. This puts the loop in a limbo state, with time suspended as nothing happens. This is the most unclear of the three endings however, it brings something out of Colt that we haven't seen before, indecisiveness. The great thing about these endings is that the game allows the player to choose their own fates.</br>

<br>AESTHETICS AND STYLE</br>
<br>Deathloop's style is what sets the game apart. The game is colorful yet nostalgic, with older-looking architecture, weapons, furniture, and clothing. This style is from the 60s-70s, which is called metamodernism. The unique style of the game adds depth to the overall narrative and makes the player think about where they are and what they are playing. The game feels vintage. It feels like you are looking through an old TV. The character design seems real, yet there is some cartoon flair, which I personally like.</br>
<br>The sound design within the game is also important to note. In most of the game, you are lurking around looking for visionaries to kill. The people of Blackreef are out to kill Colt, and if they see you, they will try to kill you or report you. As you lurk around, the sound experience is all around you, and spatial sound within the game is an experience like no other. It puts you inside the game world and allows you to engage with the world around you on a much deeper level.</br>
<br>Here is an audio sample of the older guns and soundscapes within the game:</br>

<br>The idea of "suture" for me in this game is the style and design of the game. The constant new things you see in the game stitch together a play-through experience like no other. Each new map you get to explore is different than the last, with new people to find and weapons as well. Just like a film being sutured together, the game is sutured together through great visuals and unique world-building. The story not only feels authentic but you feel as though you are inside the world playing the game. It hooked me from the get go allowing me to have an experience I haven't been able to have in any other game. It's so fun just walking around the map and looking at the sights. The map has little rooms and easter eggs so to speak that add to depth of the game. There are little details like posters and things that the people of Blackreef say which shows how much work the design team put into creating this game.</br>
