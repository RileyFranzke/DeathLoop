    <h2>Deathloop: Aesthetics and Style</h2>
  <br>In 2021 Arkane Studios released "Deathloop" a small first person shooter with little marketing and low price on Steam. The game is unique mixing a futuristic world with older, nostalgic aesthetics. The world built within the game is gorgeous yet mysterious. Character movement is fluid while gunplay is realistic and ridgid. The game is complex with many character elements changing how one can play and many narrative objectives raising stakes and keeping the player engaged. Below is the game's official launch trailer:</br>
